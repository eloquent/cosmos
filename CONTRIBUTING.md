## Branching and pull requests

As a guideline, please follow this process:

1. [Fork the repository].
2. Create a topic branch for the change, branching from **develop**
(`git checkout -b branch-name develop`).
3. Make the relevant changes.
4. [Squash] commits if necessary (`git rebase -i develop`).
5. Submit a pull request to the **develop** branch.

## Tests

- Run the tests with `vendor/bin/phpunit path/to/tests`, or simply
  `vendor/bin/phpunit` to run the entire suite.
- Generate a coverage report with
  `vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.coverage.xml path/to/tests`, or simply
  `vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.coverage.xml` to generate coverage for the
  entire suite. The coverage report will be created at
  `artifacts/tests/coverage/index.html`.
- Run the integration tests with `test/integration/run-all`. Each test suite has
  one passing, and one failing test. This demonstrates *Phony*'s output.
- Run the benchmarks with `vendor/bin/athletic -p test/benchmarks`. This
  compares *Phony*'s performance with other mocking frameworks.
